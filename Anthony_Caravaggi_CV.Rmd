## Research   
I employ field and laboratory-based experiments, along with archival data, to answer specific questions relating to the ecology of species and communities to inform conservation, management and policy-related processes. My current work includes an analysis of mammal activity patterns, landscape-scale habitat and distribution modelling, quantification of the impacts of non-native rodents on insular seabirds and an assessment of wildlife management practises.   

**Research interests**; Conservation biology; urban ecology; invasive species; population & community ecology; movement & spatial ecology; rare and endangered species; sustainability; rewilding; citizen science

> **Science communication**  

I am a strong supporter of science communication and outreach. I believe that it is important to encourage an interest in science and the natural world in people of all ages. Moreover, the success or failure of many modern conservation objectives increasingly require a connection with and understanding of the public. I have given talks to over 20 school, local interest, community and natural history groups in the UK, USA and Canada, in-person and via video calls.
